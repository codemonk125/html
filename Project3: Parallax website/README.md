Parallax Effect:
The parallax effect is a visual effect where the background images move at a different speed than the foreground elements, creating an illusion of depth and perspective as the user scrolls or interacts with the website. It adds a dynamic and immersive element to the overall user experience.
The parallax effect is achieved by using multiple layers of images or elements positioned at different distances from the viewer. As the user scrolls, these layers move at varying speeds, creating the impression of depth and motion. This effect can be used to create a variety of engaging visual experiences, such as revealing content, storytelling, or showcasing products.

Parallax Website:
A parallax website is a website that incorporates the parallax effect extensively throughout its design. These websites typically have a one-page layout with different sections or "scrolling layers" that move at different speeds as the user scrolls down the page.
